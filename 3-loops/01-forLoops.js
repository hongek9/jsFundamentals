/* FOR LOOPS

NOTE: There is a danger of infinite loops. There are three main parts to a loop. 
1) The 'for' keyword
2) A variable initialization and declaration. 
3) The condition that needs to be met in order to end the loop.
4) This is where the number is going to update. This one is saying each time this loop runs, update i by one. 
5) Inside of the code block for the loop, refers to the current value of the variable for that loop

//Challenge: using for loop, count to 20, by 2's
for(let i = 0; i <=20; i+=2){

//Challenge: using a for loop, count from 10 to 0, going down by 1's
for(let i = 10; i >=0; i--){
    console.log(i);
}

//Challenge: using a for loop, count from 0, going down by 2's, to -24
for(let i = 0; i >=-24; i-=2){

//Challenge: using a for loop, go through a name and display each letter individually
let name = 'Ellie';
for(let i = 0; i < name.length; i++){
    console.log(name[i]);
}

//Challenge: make a for loop where you add up all the numbers from 1 to 50 (should equal 1275)
let x = 0;
for(let i = 1; i <=50; i++){
    x = x + i;
}

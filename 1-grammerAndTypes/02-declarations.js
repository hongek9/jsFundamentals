Declarations are the LEFT SIDE of a variable
  It is simply the var x

Initializations are the RIGHT SIDE of a variable
  It sets the value of the variable
  It incorporates the variable name (x), the assignment operator (=), and the value (10) => x = 10
  (=) assignment operator is NOT the same as the equal operator (== or ===)

//what comments do for us:
//1) communicate with other developers by writing in plain English
//2) annotate certain sections of our code for our future selves
// Comments may feel unnecessary but the best way to understand code is to make a quick comment 
//console output of 'yay';
console.log('yay');
//i mean, it is!  we're learning to code!  :)
